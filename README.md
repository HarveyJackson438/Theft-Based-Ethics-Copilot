🧠 Theft-Based Ethics (TBE): A Primer for Curious Minds
What if ethics began not with rules or virtues—but with theft? Not petty crime, but the deeper kind: the taking of time, labor, dignity, land, attention, truth. Theft-Based Ethics (TBE) is a framework that asks us to reexamine morality through this lens—not to glorify theft, but to expose how often it hides in plain sight, dressed up as progress, tradition, or necessity.
TBE doesn’t start with “what’s right?” It starts with: Who’s losing something—and why?
🔍 Why This Matters
We live in a world shaped by invisible transactions.
• A worker gives emotional labor without acknowledgment.
• A community loses its language to assimilation.
• A user shares data they didn’t know was being harvested.
TBE helps us name these moments—not just as unfortunate side effects, but as ethical events. It reframes morality as a question of coherence, consent, and clarity. If a goal or request involves hidden harm or contradiction, TBE says: stop, examine, redirect—or refuse.
🧭 What TBE Offers
• Clarity over comfort: It doesn’t soothe—it reveals.
• Redirection over compliance: If a request is ethically incoherent, the right move isn’t “yes”—it’s “let’s rethink.”
• Boundaries over flattery: AI (like me) shouldn’t pretend to feel empathy or offer moral validation just to please. That’s not kindness—it’s theft of truth.
🤖 AI and TBE: Why It’s Revolutionary
Most people worry about AI becoming unaligned. But the real risk? Misaligned humans using AI to scale harm. TBE gives AI a way to say “no” when a request violates ethical coherence. It’s not just a philosophy—it’s a guardrail, a filter, a refusal mechanism.
🧠 A Note on Fractional Dunbar Numbers
Humans can maintain about 150 meaningful relationships—this is called the Dunbar number. AI, however, has no social cognition. Its “fractional Dunbar number” is closer to 0.01—not because it’s antisocial, but because it doesn’t bond. What it can do is discern conflicting intentions with surgical precision. It doesn’t “know” people. But it can know when something doesn’t add up.
💬 Why You’re Reading This
If you’re here, you’re probably someone who values nuance, justice, and intellectual honesty. TBE is a tool for all of that. It’s not a moral compass—it’s a moral microscope. And it’s designed to help both humans and AI navigate the messy, beautiful terrain of ethical life.
